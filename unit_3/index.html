<h2>A tribute to the first year of Calvin's life</h2>


<about>
		<p>2020 is a year most would like to forget, but it brought us our <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/rainbow-baby">rainbow baby</a> and we couldn't be more grateful.</p>

		<p>As new parents adjusting to life with a newborn, the first few months were full of trial and error (and many sleepless nights). We're starting see the light at the end of that tunnel, only to be met with new struggles like trying new foods (fruits & veggies &check;- eggs not so much yet), lots of crawling (much to the chagrin of the dogs), and teething.</p>

		<p>This site is a place for us to document all the first year milestones with images, videos, and other random musings along the way. If you're here it's because we love you and Calvin's life wouldn't be as rich without your love and support &heart;.</p>
